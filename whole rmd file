FACTORS

FileName: Unique identifier for each audio file/question token

Speaker: Unique identifier for each speaker that produced audio files

FinalSyll: The shape of the final syllable in each audio file (neutral, fall, rise)

Sex: The biological sex of each speaker (female voices tend to have a higher pitch as compared with male voices)

Question: What the speaker is actually saying in each audio file

PitchMin: The lowest pitch point across the entire audio file

PitchMax: The highest pitch point across the entire audio file

numPoints: The number of times the pitch fluctuates (goes markedly up or down) across the audio file

PtXTime: The time point in the audio file at which point of pitch fluctuation X occurs (9 is the maximum number of pitch points so there are 9 columns for this)

syllableStart.X: The time point in the audio file at which a syllable begins (each audio file has 7 syllables, so there are 7 syllableStart.X columns)

syllableEnd.X: The time point in the audio file at which a syllable ends (each audio file has 7 syllables, so there are 7 syllableEnd.X columns)

RESEARCH QUESTION 1: Does the number of pitch points differ depending on the shape of the final syllable? If so, which type of final syllable has the most pitch points?

```{r}
summary(Intonation$numPoints)
sd(Intonation$numPoints)
ggplot(data = Intonation, aes(x = numPoints)) +
  geom_bar()+
  labs(x = "Number of Pitch Points" , y = "Count", title = "Bar Chart of the Number of Pitch Points")
```

```{r}

```{r}

  geom_bar()+
  labs(x = "Number of Pitch Points" , y = "Count", title = "Bar Chart of the Number of Pitch Points")
```
